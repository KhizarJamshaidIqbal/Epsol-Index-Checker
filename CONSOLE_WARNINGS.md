# Console Warnings Explained

## ⚠️ "Extra attributes from the server: bis_skin_checked"

### What is this?
This warning is caused by **browser extensions** (not your code!) that inject attributes into your HTML.

### Common culprits:
- 🔐 **Bitwarden** - Password manager
- 🔑 **LastPass** - Password manager  
- 🛡️ **Other password managers**
- 📝 **Form auto-fill extensions**
- 🎨 **Dark mode extensions**

### Why does it happen?
Browser extensions modify the HTML by adding custom attributes like `bis_skin_checked`, `data-lastpass-icon-root`, etc. React detects these modifications during hydration and shows a warning.

### Is it a problem?
**No!** This is completely harmless and doesn't affect functionality. It's just a warning that the browser DOM doesn't match the server-rendered HTML.

### How to fix:
✅ **Already fixed!** I've added `suppressHydrationWarning` to your layout.tsx file.

### Still seeing warnings?
If you still see warnings after refresh:

**Option 1: Ignore them**
- They're cosmetic only
- Don't affect functionality
- Common in all React apps

**Option 2: Disable extensions**
- Open browser in incognito mode
- Disable browser extensions temporarily
- Use a different browser profile

**Option 3: Clear cache**
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
- Clear browser cache completely

### Pro tip:
These warnings only appear in **development mode**. In production builds (after `npm run build`), these warnings won't show at all!
